all good
val in dir needs to be: is there a line of others in this direction

def find_next_in_dir_dist

if space in dir is .
	Done
else if space is opp
	continue
else if space is yours
	return V*mult + (x, y) but just the MULT

def flip_in_dir
	for i < mult
		set i*V + (x, y) == val
		

def is_legal
	Check boundaries for match	
------------------------------------------------------------
All above good :) Now:

import/export board state
b.get_legal_moves
b.show_legal_moves

bench done as well

--------------------------------------
Distance function is now perfect!!
Gameplay rejects illegal moves!
Then play a game with yourself! (Done)
Remove legal check in play function
getLegalDirs tuple in tuple with mult, no recalculation
b.get_legal_moves
b.show_legal_moves
pass mechanic
If pass twice, go to score

Use sets if possible (for border addition/sub)	
Set up for minimax!


Bugs:
- Fix player_move function
